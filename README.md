## Power BI Dashboard Details
**Objective**:
The primary objective of this Power BI dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of patient visits and demographics, departmental referrals, and patient wait times in a healthcare setting. The dashboard aims to support decision-making by visualizing key metrics that impact patient care and operational efficiency.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:

This metric indicates the overall number of patient visits within a specified period.
**Patients by Race and Age Group** 
These KPIs help in understanding the demographic distribution of patients.
**Total Patients by Department Referral**
This measures the number of patients referred to various departments, highlighting which departments are most utilized.
**Walk-In vs. Referred Patients**
This shows the proportion of patients who walked in without an appointment versus those who were referred.
**Average Wait Time**
This is a crucial KPI for assessing the efficiency of patient processing and service delivery.
**Average Satisfaction**
This metric reflects patient satisfaction with the healthcare services received.
**Patients by Week Type (Weekday vs. Weekend)**
This helps in identifying patterns in patient visits across different days of the week.
**Emergency Room Visits**
This KPI tracks the number of visits to the emergency room.

**Conclusion**:
The Power BI dashboard effectively visualizes critical data that can help healthcare administrators make informed decisions. By analyzing patient demographics, visit patterns, departmental loads, and wait times, the healthcare facility can identify areas for improvement. For instance, the high average wait time might indicate a need for process optimization or additional staffing. The balance between walk-in and referred patients can guide resource allocation to manage patient flow efficiently. Additionally, patient satisfaction scores can highlight areas needing attention to enhance overall patient experience.

This dashboard serves as a valuable tool in enhancing healthcare delivery by providing actionable insights derived from the collected data.
